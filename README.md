# ATL Webpage
This is our school's atl lab's own custom webpage!
This website allows the students and teachers to do many things!
Like:
  - Issue one of the electronic from the lab
  - Return one of the electronic taken from the lab
  - Check out all the items in the atl
  - Check out details about other students for contact
  - Even check some of the programming paths (still in development )

For anybody intrested in using the api, ask me for the api url
